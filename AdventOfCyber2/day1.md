[Day1] Web Exploitation A Christmas Crisis.

This is my journey for Advent of Cyber 2 on tryhackme.
I found this event on my facebook news.
Tryhackme make a good event for beginner.
I like really follow a course so I decide to join the party.

The event started at 7:30 pm, it's a little late to me. 
Because I had a other job in my home, so I went to sleep with good feelings first.

As soon as get to my work, I did access to Tryhackme web-site.
Deployed a machine and I waited for about 5 minutes.
I feel that it's so long!!, but free-user have to wait long :(

First subject is a cookie maniuplation for bypass authentication.
I know this concept well because I work as a Web Security pentester.
I like this course, It didn't require to any other programs besides firefox.

I had a trouble submitting some questions.
When I looked at a encoded cookie value, I felt a little scary LoL.
but I could get a Hint each questions, and I solved all questions.

Even though, this is really simple and easy. I could get a achivement and confidence.
