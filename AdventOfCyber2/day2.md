[Day 2] Web Exploitation The Elf Strikes Back!

The purpose of Day2 was webshell upload.
THM teachs a eseential concept of HTTP for doing file upload.
If people are good at file upload and connect to reverse shell, this is not difficult at all.

In real world scenario, most websites might not allow directory listing but this lab does it.
If website has that vulnerability, anybody can see files and directories on webroot.

I solved this problom in 10 minutes.
I think this is good class for beginners.
